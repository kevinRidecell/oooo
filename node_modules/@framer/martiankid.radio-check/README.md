How to create a control group?
===
It's super simple!
To create a radio group, for example, you should

Create the **radio item** first.
---

Radio item consist of **3 elements**: `body`, `fill`, `label`.

**Draw them within the separate frame in the following order**:

`body` - at the bottom, `label` - at the top.
**Label layer** - should contain text `Label` starting from **capital letter!**.

Connect radio item to the radio group component
---

Drag the radio group to the canvas and **connect purple dot** on the side to the radio item that you've created.

You can populate options through the property field called `Options`. Just enter them separated by comma `,` without the space between options.

Design the radio item
---

The **design and appearance** of the element is up to you!
You can choose any font, text style, color, a shape of the fill and body! 

The height of the frame defines the **spacing between the radio items**. To increase or decrease the spacing - make adjustments to the height of the container frame.

How to get data from a control group?
===

You can `get selected options data` from the controls and use it however you want!

For example, you can update the text once the user selected some option in the radio group. We'll use Framer X `Overrides` function for that.

```
import { Data, Override } from "framer"

const data = Data({id: 0, name: ""})

export const HandleChange: Override = () => {
    return {
        onChange(obj) {
            data.id = obj.index
            data.name = obj.name
        }
    }
}

export const UpdateLabel: Override = () => {
    return {
        text: data.name
    }
}
```

What's left is to create a binding between the UI object and override function. Use `Code` property for that.

That's it! Have a nice prototyping! ðŸ˜‰
